**About:**
Use this tool to get the average performance of a lineup of batters against a given pitcher.

**Input:**
Enter the number of slots for each result type on each player’s card chart.
*Example: The “Batter 1” card has a BB range of “6-9” – this corresponds to 4 slots.*

**Output:**
The chance of each result is output, along with On-Base Percentage for convenience.
Because this is a simulation, every run will have slightly different results even with identical players.
